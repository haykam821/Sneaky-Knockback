Fixes server-side knockback being inconsistent for players that are sneaking.

Sneaky Knockback requires the [Fabric modloader](https://fabricmc.net/use/).

## Installation

1. Download Sneaky Knockback from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sneaky-knockback/files) or [GitHub](https://github.com/haykam821/Sneaky-Knockback/releases).
2. Place the downloaded file in your `mods` folder.

## Usage

When this mod is installed on a server, knockback will be changed to more accurately represent client-side knockback. In particular, players will no longer be able to sneak on the corner of a block in order to negate all knockback.
